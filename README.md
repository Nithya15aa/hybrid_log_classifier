Hybrid Log Classification System

    This project implements a hybrid approach to log classification using three sequential layers:

    Rule-Based Regex Classifier

    Machine Learning Classifier 

    Large Language Model (LLM) Fallback Classifier

    The system is designed for high-volume and diverse log environments where traditional single-method classification is insufficient.
